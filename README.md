If you want to solve more challenging problem, `simulator_with_intruder.py` is the code for you, where many intruder aircraft will be in this simulator.

If you have any questions or comments, or you think there are bugs in this code, don't hesitate to send me an email! I am looking for ways to make this code even more computationally efficient. Or you can also stop by my office at 2362 Howe Hall (Seat 2362-19).
